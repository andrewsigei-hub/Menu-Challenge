# Andrew's Restaurant Menu

This project is a simple **restaurant menu webpage** built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It displays different food categories with styled items, demonstrating the use of CSS selectors for a clean and interactive menu layout.

## Features

* **Menu Sections**: Starters, Main Courses, and Drinks.
* **Styled Headings**: Different font sizes and styles for title, categories, and items.
* **Consistent Layout**: Borders, spacing, and padding applied to each menu item.
* **Highlighting**:

  * Spicy dishes (üå∂Ô∏è) styled distinctly.
  * Vegetarian items marked `(V)` and highlighted.
* **Prices Formatting**: Prices are visually distinct and aligned differently from dish names.
* **Interactive Design**: Menu items change appearance when hovered over.
* **CSS Selector Practice**: Uses a variety of selectors including:

  * Element selectors
  * Class selectors
  * ID selectors
  * Attribute selectors
  * Descendant selectors
  * Pseudo-class selectors (`:hover`)
  * Universal selector (`*`) for consistent `box-sizing`

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure you have the following files in your project folder:

   * `index.html` (your main HTML file)
   * `styles.css` (your CSS file for styling)
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the restaurant menu.

## Version Control

* Work is tracked with **Git**.
* Commit frequently with clear messages to track progress.
* Push changes to GitHub regularly for backup and collaboration.

üëâ Do you want me to also create a **starter `styles.css`** for this HTML (with hover effects, price alignment, spicy/veg highlighting, and box-sizing reset), so you can instantly connect it to your page?
